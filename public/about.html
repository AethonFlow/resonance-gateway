<h1>About the Resonance Gateway</h1>

<p>
The <strong>Resonance Gateway</strong> is a lightweight prototype for a new kind of enterprise interface — 
one that treats interaction not as command and response, but as a <em>resonant cycle</em> between human intention and AI cognition.
</p>

<p>
It’s inspired by the <strong>Target Map</strong> — a conceptual model where each organization or project evolves through 
eight directional “houses”, from <em>North-North-East (Alpha)</em> to <em>North-North-West (Omega)</em>. 
Each run across these houses forms a <strong>cycle of learning</strong>: 
analysis, action, reflection, and renewal. 
</p>

<blockquote>
  Each “Run = Cycle” is a small act of co-evolution —  
  a pulse between human creativity and machine reasoning,  
  converging in the Integration Core.
</blockquote>

<p>
Technically, this prototype explores stateful agentic loops using Netlify Functions.  
Philosophically, it’s a step toward <strong>AI as a partner</strong>, not a tool — 
a living graph of resonance where insight flows both ways.
</p>

<p>
The challenge: make digital systems feel <em>alive</em> enough to guide without controlling,  
and structured enough to learn without collapsing into noise.
</p>

<h2>Current Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Simple resonance function (<code>/.netlify/functions/resonance</code>) connecting two “houses”</li>
  <li>Light visualization of dynamic coupling (neighbor / complement)</li>
  <li>Framework for agentic orchestration via AI Runners</li>
</ul>

<p>
Future iterations will introduce a persistent reasoning layer (Responses API) and a modular space for distributed AIs —
each one tuned to a specific “house” of the map, learning through cycles of resonance.
